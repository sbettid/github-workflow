       My name is Davide Sbetti and I am an exchange student coming from Italy.
        <br>
        I am 21 years old and my hometown is a small town nobody knows called Bolzano. It is near the Austrian border
        and that is the reason why at school we study also a bit of German and not only Italian and English.
        I have decided to  go abroad to improve my English skills and to live a new and different experience
        (actually, this is my first time in the US).
        <br> <br>
        Beside technology, I love all sports, in particular hiking and volleyball. I also played soccer in a club
        until I started university (team picture on the top).
